What is PECE
#############

PECE is a Free and Open Source digital platform designed to support distributed, collaborative hermenuetics research with diverse types of research data.

PECE provides a place to archive and share primary data generated by empirical humanities scholars, facilitates analytic collaboration (within the humanities and with researchers in other fields), and encourages experimentation with diverse modes of publication. It has been built and is governed by an interdisciplinary design group centered at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Troy, New York, USA), including Michael Fortun, Kim Fortun, Alli Morgan, Dominic DiFranzo, Luis Felipe Murillo, Lindsay Poirier, Brandon Costelloe-Kuehn and Brian Callahan.
