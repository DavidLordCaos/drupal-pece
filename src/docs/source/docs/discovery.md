Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there a way to search across instances of the platform?

We are hoping that this will be possible very soon. We are looking at
one module
[*https://www.drupal.org/project/apachesolr\_multisitesearch*](https://www.drupal.org/project/apachesolr_multisitesearch)
to enable this.

### A bunch of website and PDF artifacts just appeared in the platform and don’t have a contributor listed. Where did these artifacts come from?

When a [*Zotero feed is added to the platform*](#how-do-i-add-a-zotero-feed-to-the-platform), the platform
automatically imports new entries from the Zotero library every 30
minutes. Whenever new journal article or website Zotero entries are
imported to the platform, a PDF or website artifact is automatically
created with the Zotero entry listed in the [*‘bibliography’ field*](#what-does-bibliography-mean). Since the artifact is created
automatically by the platform, there will be no contributor listed for
these artifacts.
