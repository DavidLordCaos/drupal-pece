!!! note "User Accounts and Profiles"

    [Read more](../account) about how to create an account and update a user profile in PECE.

!!! note "Artifacts"

    The primary way to contribute data to the PECE archive is by creating an *artifact*. Artifacts contributed to the site can include documents, images, audio, videos, text, and web sites. Each artifact is embellished with metadata. For instructions on how to add artifacts to PECE, [read here](../artifacts).

!!! note "Groups"

    Groups are workspaces where designated site users can contribute content,
    share a field diary, write collaboratively, and publish essays. By creating groups in PECE, you can control which users on the platform have access to view and edit content. For instructions on how to create and administer groups, [read here](../groups).

!!! note "Annotations"

    Annotating an artifact involves responding to a set of shared and evolving questions that are designed to elicit various viewpoints about the artifact. In PECE, you can contribute sets of questions for annotating artifacts. We refer to these questions as *structured analytics*. For instructions on how to annotate artifacts and create structured analytics, [read here](../annotations)

!!! note "Essays"

    Artifacts and annotations in PECE can be curated into different types of *essays*. A *photo essay* curates image artifacts into a slideshow with narrative text. A *timeline essay* curates artifacts into a timeline, allowing users to visualize content temporally. A *PECE essay* is a collection of artifacts, memos, and essays, organized into a collage, with text added for context. For instructions on how to create and edit essays, [read here](../essays).

!!! note "Content Permissions"

    PECE has a several layers of permissions that can be applied to content archived in the platform. When a user selects a permission for content on the platform, it limits who can view, edit, and delete that content, depending on user roles assigned. Permissions can be set at a content level (which sets the content visibility site-wide) and at a group level (which sets the content visibility amongst group members). [Read more](../permissions) about user roles and permissions in PECE.

!!! note "Licensing"

    Users have the option to license content created in PECE with a variety of Creative Commons licenses. This communicates to other users how and under what conditions the content may be used, disseminated, and/or modified. [Read more](../licensing) about licensing content in PECE.

!!! note "Tagging"

    Users can tag content in PECE with any terms in order to characterize the content and to network the content with other content tagged with the same term on the platform. For suggestions on how to effectively tag content in PECE, [read here](../tagging).

!!! note "Projects"

    A *project* designates a research project that the platform is being used to scaffold. You can use this content type to describe when a project starts and ends, its institutional affiliation, and its funding source. By creating a *fieldsite* in PECE, users can designate certain content as deriving from a particular geographic location. For instructions on how to add projects and fieldsites to PECE, [read here](../projects).

!!! note "Logics"

    *Substantive logics* document the rationale for running a particular instance of PECE or for conducting a particular research project. *Design logics* document critical directives that have guided the architecture and design of PECE itself. Read more about Design Logics and Substantive Logics [here](../logics).

!!! note "Discovery"

    PECE is in part an experiment with alternative forms of knowledge organization. Because of this, the organization of the platform might, for some users, feel non-intuitive. For more information about how to find content on PECE, [read here](../discovery).

!!! note "A Note on PECE"

    PECE itself is a software distribution that you can download and install to support an ethnographic research project. You may hear us refer to this as the [**PECE distribution**](https://github.com/PECE-project/pece-distro), or PECE distro. When researchers download this distribution onto their server, they run an *instance* of PECE. [**STS Infrastructures**](http://stsinfrastructures.org), [**The Asthma Files**](http://theasthmafiles.org/) and the [**Disaster-STS-Network**](http://disaster-sts-network.org/) are instances of the PECE distro. Whenever new code is packaged into the distro, existing instances of PECE need to be updated in order for the new code to be integrated.
