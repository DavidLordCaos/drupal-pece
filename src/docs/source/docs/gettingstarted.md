Introduction to PECE
=====================

### PECE in 15 Steps: A Typical Workflow

1.  Outline the rationale for your project by [*creating substantive logics*](../usersguide#what-is-a-substantive-logic) in the platform and associating them with the project.

2.  [*Formalize a project*](../usersguide#what-is-a-project) by adding its metadata to the platform.

3.  Outline fieldsites for your project by [*creating fieldsites*](../usersguide#what-is-a-fieldsite) in the platform.

4.  [*Create a group*](../usersguide#what-is-a-group) where you can share empirical materials related to the project.

5.  [*Write field notes*](../usersguide#what-is-the-difference-between-a-text-artifact-and-a-field-note) and share them in the group space.

6.  [*Develop shared questions*](../usersguide#how-do-i-create-a-structured-analytic) for the group to ask of empirical materials.

7.  Archive empirical materials by [*creating artifacts*](../usersguide#how-do-i-add-content) and [*adding them into your group space*](../usersguide#how-do-i-add-content-ive-created-to-a-group).

8.  [*Configure permissions*](#permissions) for artifacts you’ve added to the platform.

9. [*Annotate empirical materials*](../usersguide#how-do-i-annotate-an-artifact) with shared questions.

10. [*Juxtapose*](../usersguide#how-do-i-see-how-others-annotated-an-artifact) annotation responses through PECE user interfaces.

11. [*Write a memo*](../usersguide#how-do-i-create-a-memo) to begin synthesizing what you’ve learned from analysis.

12. Comment on other group member memos.

13. [*Create a photo essay*](../usersguide#how-do-i-create-a-photo-essay) with images collected during the project.

14. [*Create a timeline essay*](../usersguide#) to visualize artifacts contributed to the platform temporally.

15. [*Create a PECE essay*](../usersguide#how-do-i-create-a-pece-essay), collaging artifacts with analysis and free text.

!!! note "Artifacts"

    The primary way to contribute data to the PECE archive is by creating an *artifact*. Artifacts contributed to the site can include documents, images, audio, videos, text, and web sites. Each artifact is embellished with metadata. For instructions on how to add artifacts to PECE, [read here](../artifacts).

!!! note "A Note on PECE"

    PECE itself is a software distribution that you can download and install to support an ethnographic research project. You may hear us refer to this as the [**PECE distribution**](https://github.com/PECE-project/pece-distro), or PECE distro. When researchers download this distribution onto their server, they run an *instance* of PECE. [**STS Infrastructures**](http://stsinfrastructures.org), [**The Asthma Files**](http://theasthmafiles.org/) and the [**Disaster-STS-Network**](http://disaster-sts-network.org/) are instances of the PECE distro. Whenever new code is packaged into the distro, existing instances of PECE need to be updated in order for the new code to be integrated.
