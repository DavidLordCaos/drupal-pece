Tagging
=======

In accordance with our [Design Logics](../logics), there are no folders in PECE. Instead content gets characterized and organized via tags. When you navigate to a tag page in PECE, you will see, in random order, a list of all content that has been tagged with that term. To make the most of this form of knowledge organization, we encourage you to consider the following:

-   When possible and appropriate, try to use existing tags rather than creating your own. As you begin typing a tag, PECE will offer suggestions of existing tags.

-   Tag each term separately rather than adding conjunction punctuation to show hierarchy. There is no benefit on this platform to linking words together in a hierarchy. For instance, there is no benefit on this platform to tagging an artifact with ‘Colors – Blue’ rather than tagging the artifact with both ‘Colors’ and ‘Blue’. In fact tagging in the former is likely to inhibit others from stumbling across your content.
