Data Type Glossary
=====================

-   Substantive Logic: Substantive logics document the rationale for running a particular instance of PECE or for conducting a particular research project. They can be associated with Projects or Groups.

-   Project: A project designates a research project that the platform is being used to scaffold. You can use this content type to describe when a project starts and ends, its institutional affiliation, and its funding source.

-   Fieldsite: A fieldsite is a reference to a certain geographic location where research will be conducted. You can link artifacts to fieldsites to document where the artifact was found.

-   Group: Groups are workspaces where several individuals can contribute content, share a field diary, write collaboratively, and publish essays.

-   Artifact: An artifact is the basic unit of data on PECE. Artifacts represent materials that an ethnographer determines to be data relevant to the site; this can include documents, images, audio, videos, and web sites, which could include field notes, interviews, news articles, journal articles, films, etc.

-   Artifact bundle: An artifact bundle is an artifact of artifacts. You can create an artifact bundle to annotate a group of artifacts together.

-   Analytic: An analytic is a question designed to elicit various viewpoints about the artifact. Questions can be categorized into Structured Analytics (named sets of questions).

-   Annotation: Annotating an artifact involves responding to a set of shared and evolving questions that are designed to elicit various viewpoints about the artifact. In the vocabulary of literature (the humanities field most akin to our tradition of anthropology), you can think of annotating an artifact as “reading” an artifact. Each reading, performed by different individuals, produces different interpretive insights that broaden and deepen the collaborative analysis of an artifact.

-   Memo: A memo is a first draft of a piece of writing that may be published on the site. Upon publishing a memo, that memo is opened for comments from the platform’s community.

-   Photo Essay: a collection of image artifacts, ordered into a slideshow, with text added for context.

-   PECE Essay: a collection of artifacts, memos, and essays, organized into a collage, with text added for context
