The Platform for Experimental, Collaborative Ethnography (PECE) is a Free and Open Source (Drupal-based) digital platform that supports multi-sited, cross-scale ethnographic and historical research. The platform links researchers in new ways, enables new kinds of analyses and data visualization, and activates researchers\u2019 engagement with public problems and diverse audiences. PECE is at the center of a research project that explores how digital infrastructure can be designed to support collaborative hermeneutics. PECE has been built and is governed by an interdisciplinary design group centered at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Troy, New York, USA). While designed to support the particular needs of experimental ethnography projects, PECE provides a general model for the digital humanities, and particularly the empirical digital humanities (including work in history, anthropology, and other fields that collect and analyze primary data, using hermeneutic techniques). PECE\u2019s \u201cdesign logics\u201d translate critical theoretical commitments (to perspectival multiplicity, for example) into digital terms. PECE provides a place to archive and share primary data generated by empirical humanities scholars, facilitates analytic collaboration, and encourages experimentation with diverse modes of publication. The platform encourages humanities scholars to experiment with digitally-mediated, interdisciplinary collaboration, provides opportunities to involve students in humanities research as it progresses, and quickens the public availability of humanities research in an open access form. PECE also enables experimentation with new forms of peer review for humanities research, and functions as a portal to a suite of open source tools useful for humanities research, including tools developed in data science for other scientific communities. PECE\u2019s design is both theoretically inflected and ethnographically grounded: platform design has been oriented by \u201cdesign logics\u201d drawn from cultural, social, and language theories, oriented by the constantly evolving needs of The Asthma Files (TAF), a collaborative ethnographic project focused on diverse ways people in settings around the world have experienced and responded to the global asthma epidemic and air pollution crisis. PECE\u2019s design group has now developed and tested multiple digital functions that enable ethnographic collaboration. In the next phase of the project, we will refine existing functions and develop others, through side-by-side development of diverse ethnographic projects on separate platforms. Numerous instances of PECE (some only at the concept-stage) demonstrate its potential: The Asthma Files illustrates how PECE can support a collaborative research project (with shared questions linking project participants). The Disaster-STS Research Network illustrates how PECE can support an international research network, in this instance connecting researchers around the world studying how disasters of different types, in different regions of the world, are anticipated and managed. We have also conceptualized instances of PECE for individual researchers (at different stages of their careers), and for different kinds of practitioners (people needing to manage chronic illness and associated documentation, encounters with diverse medical specialists, etc.). Development of PECE helps address the global challenge of creating research infrastructure to support deeply interdisciplinary and international research that addresses complex problems such as global environmental health, and disaster prevention, response and recovery. Such problems have dimensions that require the integration of data and analysis from the humanities, social and natural sciences, and engineering, and thus will require robust digital infrastructure for humanities researchers, designed to be interoperable with research infrastructure developed for other fields. To ensure such interoperability, we have worked closely with data scientists at Rensselaer, and within the Research Data Alliance (RDA), an international initiative to enhance capacity to archive, preserve, analyze, and share data within and across research communities. Background The PECE project extends from work in cultural anthropology over the last few decades that foregrounds how cultural critique, innovation and change emerge, and the significance of the genre forms through which culture is expressed (Marcus and Fischer 1986; Clifford and Marcus 1986). This thread of work in cultural anthropology has drawn on literary and language theory to address the significance of genre forms both in everyday enactment of culture in different settings, and in scholarly representations of culture. PECE extends this thread of work into the digital domain through a platform design that reflects critical insight from theories of language, literature, and ethnography, built out organically with original ethnographic material. Thus, while designed to reflect critical theory, PECE is also ethnographically grounded, collaborative in nature, and expressly experimental: the platform is designed to permit change as called for by evolving ethnographic engagements. This entwined development process has been challenging but has proven robust, allowing us to identify needs and explore computational possibilities from within humanities work, learning about and building the kinds of tools that are critical when ethnographers work collaboratively, especially on complex topics involving multiple sites, scales and actors, and many different kinds of \u201cdata.\u201d We work on PECE aware of long-standing effort, often experimental in tenor, to integrate new technologies and media into the work and expression of cultural analysis. Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead\u2019s stunning work with photography \u2013 as both a research tool and means of conveying their analysis \u2013 comes immediately to mind (Bateson and Mead 1942; Jacknis 1988). The history of filmmaking in the conduct and expression of cultural analysis has also laid important ground, generating impressive methodological debates and innovation, and a body of work that literally provides different angles on matters of interest and concern to cultural analysts. Digital tools and modes of presentation add still other possibilities for getting at and sharing understanding of how \u201cculture\u201d works \u2013 in historical, geographic, political, economic and media context, always in need of deeper or alternative ways of understanding. The goal of PECE could be described as kaleidoscopic, enriching cultural analysis through use of an ever-evolving array of techniques and technologies \u2013 which, together, multiply perspective, give texture to insight, and animate reflexivity. Rationale The development of PECE has been motivated by an array of concerns that we have come to call \u201csubstantive logics.\u201d Continual cultivation of growing list of substantive logics for the PECE Project itself, as well as for other instances of PECE, is a way to keep tuned to the historical and political conditions in which we work, integrating empirical and theoretical understanding.[1] The contemporary \u2013 globalized, high-tech, anthropogenic \u2013 world generates complex risks and problems at an unprecedented pace \u2013 calling for new levels of operational coordination within and across disciplines, and between researchers and practical decision-makers working at many scales (local to transnational). Researchers thus need to develop modes of work \u2013 and supporting infrastructure \u2013 that enable deep and complex collaborations of different kinds. PECE aspires to provide such infrastructure. Given the complexity \u2013 scientific, technical, cultural, and so on \u2013 of contemporary problems there is a special need to cultivate and sustain different ways of thinking about problems. As feminist theorists have long argued (Keller, Turkle), epistemological pluralism offers the best chance of understanding and figuring out ways to respond to complex problems. Care thus must be taken to keep collaborative practices from being over-determined; collaboration needs to produce and steward what the PECE project has termed \u201ckaleidoscopic logic.\u201d Preserving and extending the special perspectives of humanities researchers on contemporary problems poses particular challenges, partly because of technocratic habits of thinking in many practical decision-making domains. It is thus important to work to extend the practical relevance of humanities knowledge experimentally, drawing on deep (theoretical) insight into the ways meaning, knowledge, and culture \u201cwork.\u201d Experimentation (and testing) is called for in the production, expression, and circulation of humanities knowledge, all of which are supported by PECE. Given the complexity of problems many empirical humanities researchers are concerned with as well as escalating constraints on research funding, humanities researchers need to develop infrastructure and governance for sharing research data. They also need to better \u201cexpose\u201d (in the language of computer sciences) the many stages of humanities knowledge production \u2014 so that there are possibilities for collaboration at all stages, and associated work can be attributed (thus crediting individual contributions in collaborative projects). Work at faultlines between different scales, cultures, and disciplinary communities reliably produces rupture and new lines of work (Traweek), partly because such interaction inevitably troubles established categories and modes of sense making, often producing double-binds (Bateson). The collaborative work supported by PECE thus promises to be vitalizing for the humanities writ large, and particularly the empirical humanities. Post-structural studies and theories of language have demonstrated how stabilized meaning is always partial, forced, and marginalizing (and thus often violent) (Derrida, Spivak, de Lauretis) \u2013 pointing to a need and possibility for productively unstable knowledge infrastructure and practice (Derrida, Spivak, de Lauretis). This is particularly the case in contexts of dramatic change, with enduring and emergent forms of injustice; in such contexts, established paradigms are insufficient for dealing with matters at hand. Poststructural insight thus has particularly relevance today, suggesting the way humanities insight can undergird contemporary efforts to support interdisciplinarity and innovation. PECE is designed to demonstrate this. Given the density of information flows today, laced with conflicts of interpretation and interests, practitioners in many domains need highly developed hermeneutic sensibilities, and a high capacity for collaboration \u2013 not only in carrying out concrete tasks, but also for thinking through what tasks should be carried out, how they should be prioritized, and how problem identification both directs practical work, and quickly makes alternative pathways invisible. PECE provides a space to experiment with and examine different forms of collaboration and thus can result in research findings with clear relevance to capacity building efforts in practitioner communities. As described below, we\u2019ve also conceptualized an instance of PECE designed to serve practitioners themselves \u2013 patients dealing with chronic illnesses, for example, or community groups dealing with concerns about toxic chemical contamination. Aims and Questions PECE is at the center of a research effort to understand how digital infrastructure can be designed to support and sustain further development of the empirical humanities. Recognition of diversity within the humanities and even the empirical humanities is foundational to the project. The specific focus of the PECE project is on the challenges associated with poststructural, postcolonial and feminist theories of language, knowledge and politics. The PECE project works to delineate the work flows and practices that reflect scholarship in this vein, and the ways digital infrastructure can support them. The PECE project also aspires to develop collaborative capacity among scholars, mobilizing poststructural understanding of the dynamics through which communication and knowledge are engendered. The research questions that orient the PECE project include the following: What work flows, data types and analytic modes characterize experimental ethnography? What theories and assumptions about language, meaning, knowledge and sociality undergird experimental ethnography? What are the digital implications of the work flows, analytic modes and assumptions of experimental ethnography? How has experimental ethnography in different historical periods leveraged media technologies (photography, film, etc.), and what new possibilities are created by digital technologies? How do the digital implications of experimental ethnography align with conventional approaches to cyberinfrastructure development for research communities? How can experimental ethnography be extended (and possibly transformed) through new, digitally enabled modes of collaboration, analysis, and expression? How can experimental ethnography be configured so that its data and findings can be integrated with data and findings from other research fields (including the natural sciences, engineering and health)? What (conceptual, technical, etc.) advantages \u2013 and disadvantages \u2013 result from conceptualization of experimental ethnography data as \u201cbig data\u201d? What digital structure and functions can support \u2013 and continually extend \u2013 experimental ethnography\u2019s signature mode of knowledge production?","title":"About PECE"},{"location":"about/#about-pece","text":"","title":"About PECE"},{"location":"about/#what-is-pece","text":"The Platform for Experimental, Collaborative Ethnography (PECE) is a Free and Open Source (Drupal-based) digital platform that supports multi-sited, cross-scale ethnographic and historical research.

Since then, the PECE design team has gone through several iterations of the platform. In 2013, we began development of PECE on the content management system Plone; however due to the technical and epistemological challenges that the system posed, we moved to the content management system Drupal in 2014. The first attempt to design PECE with Drupal involved configuring factory standard Drupal features and add-on modules, using administrative menus offered through-the-Web . Using the Features module, we were able to standardize certain configurations on one instance and then push them out to other instances of the platform. However, in order to package PECE into a distribution that could be downloaded and used by any ethnographic project, we realized that we would need to hire developers to formalize our configurations, secure our permissions system, and develop new software modules. In 2015, we hired the Brazil-based Drupal development company Taller to begin developing PECE as a Github distribution. Since 2015, we have formalized a data model, a permissions system, a workflow, and several user interfaces. The first version of the distribution was released in March 2016, and since then we have released 3 updates to the distribution, each offering additional features and improved user interfaces. We also hired the development company Agaric to work on specific modules for PECE in the fall of 2015. Agaric took over development of a module to integrate Zotero feeds with Drupal platforms and developed a module to integrate Archival Resource Keys in Drupal platforms. Both of these modules are available through the Drupal site at https://www.drupal.org/platform-for-experimental-collaborative-ethnography . The Zotero module has been configured and is available in the PECE distribution and the ARK module should be available through PECE shortly. Today, we have one lead developer, Renato Vasconcellos Gomes, working full-time to add new features to the platform. What\u2019s the difference between the development repository, the distribution, and an instance of PECE? When new functionality is created for PECE, it does not immediately get updated in the site that you are using. Once new code is developed and tested for PECE, it is pushed to a development repository on Github. The PECE Tech Team then packages this code up into a more stable version of the development repository for distribution. You will hear us refer to this as the PECE distribution , or PECE distro. Any set of researchers can download this distribution onto their server in order to run an instance of PECE. STS Infrastructures , The Asthma Files and the Disaster-STS-Network are instances of the PECE distro. Whenever new code is packaged into the distro, existing instances of PECE need to be updated in order for the new code to be integrated. Current Development Process There are several steps that we must move through in order to make changes in the platform. First, we must have funding available to pay our developers and a proposal that\u2019s been approved through the university to work with them. We have a very long list of features that we would like added to the platform, as well as a long list of bugs that we would like fixed, so second we need to prioritize the change within this list. Once we begin working on a change, it must go through phases of development, testing, and approval to be added to the Github development repository. Once the change is in the development repository, it has to be packaged into the PECE distribution, and once packaged into the PECE distribution, each instance of PECE needs to be updated in order for the change to appear. Each of these steps involves coordinating different stakeholders (many of whom are involved in many other projects and most of whom are volunteering time to work on PECE) and overcoming bureaucratic barriers. This means that requests for changes could take several weeks or even months. We would really like for PECE to be a resource that researchers find useful; however, we ask that you be patient with us when requesting fixes and new features. How to report a bug or request a feature If you do notice a bug in the platform, or if there is a feature that you really believe would support your work, we ask that you follow the following steps: Check our GitHub issue page to see if someone else has reported the bug or requested the feature. Search this document to see if your question has been answered within it. If you\u2019ve gone through steps 1 and 2 and still don\u2019t see your issue listed, please navigate to the following form for reporting your concern. Once you submit the form, an issue will be created on our GitHub issue page. You can monitor this page to see who has been assigned to your issue and to track progress on addressing it. We sometimes get several emails a day pointing out bugs or requesting fixes in the platform. Following these steps will ensure that we don\u2019t lose your request and that we can prioritize them appropriately. It will also dramatically speed up the time that we can get up to speed on the issue, as many of our follow-up questions will be answered through the form. Introduction to PECE Data Model Data Type Glossary Substantive Logic: Substantive logics document the rationale for running a particular instance of PECE or for conducting a particular research project. They can be associated with Projects or Groups. Project: A project designates a research project that the platform is being used to scaffold. You can use this content type to describe when a project starts and ends, its institutional affiliation, and its funding source. Fieldsite: A fieldsite is a reference to a certain geographic location where research will be conducted. You can link artifacts to fieldsites to document where the artifact was found. Group: Groups are workspaces where several individuals can contribute content, share a field diary, write collaboratively, and publish essays. Artifact: An artifact is the basic unit of data on PECE. Artifacts represent materials that an ethnographer determines to be data relevant to the site; this can include documents, images, audio, videos, and web sites, which could include field notes, interviews, news articles, journal articles, films, etc. Artifact bundle: An artifact bundle is an artifact of artifacts. You can create an artifact bundle to annotate a group of artifacts together. Analytic: An analytic is a question designed to elicit various viewpoints about the artifact. Questions can be categorized into Structured Analytics (named sets of questions). Annotation: Annotating an artifact involves responding to a set of shared and evolving questions that are designed to elicit various viewpoints about the artifact. In the vocabulary of literature (the humanities field most akin to our tradition of anthropology), you can think of annotating an artifact as \u201creading\u201d an artifact. Each reading, performed by different individuals, produces different interpretive insights that broaden and deepen the collaborative analysis of an artifact. Memo: A memo is a first draft of a piece of writing that may be published on the site. Upon publishing a memo, that memo is opened for comments from the platform\u2019s community. Photo Essay: a collection of image artifacts, ordered into a slideshow, with text added for context. PECE Essay: a collection of artifacts, memos, and essays, organized into a collage, with text added for context PECE in 15 Steps: A Typical Workflow Outline the rationale for your project by creating substantive logics in the platform and associating them with the project. Formalize a project by adding its metadata to the platform. Outline fieldsites for your project by creating fieldsites in the platform. Upload a project bibliography from Zotero. Create a group where you can share empirical materials related to the project. Write field notes and share them in the group space. Develop shared questions for the group to ask of empirical materials. Archive empirical materials by creating artifacts and adding them into your group space . Configure permissions for artifacts you\u2019ve added to the platform. Annotate empirical materials with shared questions. Juxtapose annotation responses through PECE user interfaces. Write a memo to begin synthesizing what you\u2019ve learned from analysis. Comment on other group member memos. Create a photo essay with images collected during the project. Create a PECE essay , collaging artifacts with analysis and free text. Data Model Overview Each box in the following workflow represents a node or content type in the platform and each line illustrates how different nodes are or can be linked. Detailed Data Model Permissions User roles There are three user roles in the system, which the site administrator distributes when users request an account on the platform. Anonymous users can visit the site and can see any content that has been designated as public. Contributors can log-in to the site, manage a profile, join groups, and contribute content to the site. They have access to content that has been designated as public or their own content that they\u2019ve designated as private. Researchers are typically those individuals on a project that have been IRB-approved to view collaborative research materials. Researchers have all of the same capabilities as a contributor, except that they can also view content that has been designated as Restricted. Content Permissions There are three permissions which can be applied to content that is created on the platform. Designating content permissions determines which site visitors and users will be able to view content. Content designated as Open can be seen by any of the platform\u2019s site visitors unless the content has been given special group content restrictions . Content designated as Restricted can be seen only by the platform users that have been designated as Researchers (See User Roles ). Content designated as Private can only be seen by the content\u2019s creator. Group permissions Any group that is created on the platform can either be public or private. These permissions are selected when creating a group . Public groups will be accessible by any platform visitor. Additionally, all content associated with a public group will be public to the platform by default. Private groups will be accessible only to group members. When not logged-in, private groups will not be listed anywhere on the platform and cannot be searched for. All content associated with a private group will be private to the group members by default. Group content permission settings can be overridden using the group content visibility setting when creating content on the platform. Group content permissions When creating a piece of content, you can use the group content permissions field to override the group\u2019s default content permissions . This means that you can designate content that has been associated with a private group as \u201cpublic\u201d or content that has been associated with a public group as \u201cprivate.\u201d Overview - Who will see my content? PECE Wishlist Groups Groups will be able to maintain a group bibliography. Groups will have a forum space where they can facilitate group discussions. Artifacts Users can create an artifact that embeds content or widgets stored elsewhere through an iFrame. This will allow embedding YouTube videos, Google Calendars, and other cool things. All fieldnotes on the site will have a title based on the user that created it and the date it was created. Annotations and Analytics On annotation pages, users will be able to filter the annotations according to how they\u2019ve been tagged. Memos, Essays, and Other Visualizations The memo page will be redesigned so that groups can be linked from them. Users will be able to create timelines. On the PECE Essay the card view will allow users to display PDFs rather than just icons linking to PDFs. User experience/interface All of the icons on the site will be clickable, along with the links that they are attached to. Similar tags or misspelled tags on the site will be merged automatically. Data Management All content on the site can be assigned a unique Archival Resource Key. The site will require that all artifacts be uniquely named. There will be options to add metadata about a collaborative project\u2019s agreed upon techniques and equipment. Discovery We are working to enhance capacity to search across multiple instances of PECE. Site Administration We hope to eventually create options where user data that has been licensed with a Creative Commons license can be maintained, while All Rights Reserved data can be deleted with the user. The admin role will be configured with additional options. Known Bugs Groups When you click the \u201cRequest Group Membership\u201d button in a certain group, the box changes to \u201cUnsubscribe from Group\u201d even before the group\u2019s administrator approves your membership. You will not be able to add to the group, and it will not display on your Dashboard until the administrator approves your membership. Soon this button will display \u201cGroup Membership Pending\u201d in the interim. Only 5 group members display under the \u201cMembers\u201d heading of the group page. Soon all group members will display with the Owner of the group listed at the top. Annotations and Analytics On the Annotated Artifacts tab of user\u2019s dashboard, links to annotations display rather than links to artifacts that the user has annotated.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"gettingstarted/#pece-development","text":"","title":"PECE Development"},{"location":"gettingstarted/#background","text":"The development of PECE as a stand-alone platform began in 2011. Since then, the PECE design team has gone through several iterations of the platform. In 2013, we began development of PECE on the content management system Plone; however due to the technical and epistemological challenges that the system posed, we moved to the content management system Drupal in 2014. The first attempt to design PECE with Drupal involved configuring factory standard Drupal features and add-on modules, using administrative menus offered through-the-Web . Using the Features module, we were able to standardize certain configurations on one instance and then push them out to other instances of the platform. However, in order to package PECE into a distribution that could be downloaded and used by any ethnographic project, we realized that we would need to hire developers to formalize our configurations, secure our permissions system, and develop new software modules. In 2015, we hired the Brazil-based Drupal development company Taller to begin developing PECE as a Github distribution. Since 2015, we have formalized a data model, a permissions system, a workflow, and several user interfaces. The first version of the distribution was released in March 2016, and since then we have released 3 updates to the distribution, each offering additional features and improved user interfaces. We also hired the development company Agaric to work on specific modules for PECE in the fall of 2015. Agaric took over development of a module to integrate Zotero feeds with Drupal platforms and developed a module to integrate Archival Resource Keys in Drupal platforms. Both of these modules are available through the Drupal site at https://www.drupal.org/platform-for-experimental-collaborative-ethnography .

PECE is a Free Software-based Drupal distribution, therefore the standard installation procedure for Drupal 7 applies to PECE with a few extra dependencies. The following instructions have been tested on a Debian 8 (jessie) server, but they are not OS-dependent. PECE should run on any system supported by Drupal 7. PECE has been tested in virtual machines with 256M allocated for PHP, being 128M the recommended minimum for Drupal 7 distributions. Your configuration, of course, may vary considerably depending on the usage you are making of the platform. Refer to our data management guidelines under the \u201csustainability\u201d section to learn about the recommended minimum specs for your servers. Downloading the Distro Our distribution is currently being developed on Github. You can obtain the most updated version following the link \u201cReleases\u201d on the project\u2019s git repository: https://github.com/PECE-project/pece-distro Alternatively, you can obtain the source code and build the distro yourself if you intend to help our team by fixing bugs and extending the platform for your research purposes: git clone https://github.com/PECE-project/drupal-pece.git If you are a developer who wants to contribute to PECE, you will need to follow special instructions to install and configure the tools for building the distro. Consult the sub-section Setting up the Development Environment below for more information. Dependencies PECE has extra dependencies in addition to the ones you will need for Drupal 7 core: cURL php-mcrypt (for AES encryption support in backups and user passwords) php-ssh2 (for backup SFTP support, installed via PHP pear) Quick Install If you have the server backend already set-up, you can quickly install PECE following these steps: Clone the \u2018\u2019pece-distro\u2019\u2019 repository: git clone https://github.com/PECE-project/pece-distro.git Create an empty database: mysql -u \\$YOUR_USER -p -e \"CREATE DATABASE \\$YOUR_DB_NAME CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;\" Proceed to the URL in which your Drupal will reside, i.e. https://worldpece.org. From there, you can install PECE like any other Drupal site. Follow the Drupal.org official documentation if you need further help . In the section Troubleshooting below we describe common issues users have when trying to install PECE without the proper backend dependencies, configurations, and permissions. One important note: please, make sure to set the permissions on the filesystem properly. We cannot emphasize this enough. The official Drupal documentation explains how to do so, if you have questions. (In our experience, we have needed to set the file permissions at sites/default/files/artifacts to 770 and sites/default/files/private to 770.) I\u2019ve installed PECE, but none of my links are working. What is going on? Your webserver is not properly configured to support what is called \u201cClean URLs\u201d on Drupal. Make sure you have your httpd \u201crewrite\u201d rules properly set-up. This configuration can be done in the vhost file of your nginx configuration, following the Perusio guide or using the default.htaccess file that is provided by default by Drupal if you are running Apache. When should the admin log-in credentials be used? Distribute admin log-in credentials to as few users as possible. Admin log-in credentials should only be used to configure settings and to approve new users. The admin credentials should not be used to add content or comment on content. How do I update the site information? Go to \u201cAdministration \u00bb Configuration \u00bb System \u00bb Site information\u201d and fill out the information about your site name, the basic admin password, contact, timezone and other relevant info. How do I add a logo and change site colors? Go to \u201cAdministration \u00bb Appearance \u00bb Settings \u00bb PECE Scholarly Lite. Under the heading, Logo image settings, uncheck the box to use the default logo. Choose a file to upload as the logo. To change site colors, scroll down on this page to the heading \u201cMtT Settings.\u201d Click the \u201cLook\u2019n\u2019Feel\u201d link. Check the box to use a Custom Color Scheme. Select a Primary color (header and icons), Secondary color (links), and Tertiary color (color to appear on hover in main navigation). Click \u201cSave Configuration.\u201d How do I upload the terms of service? Go to \u201cAdministration \u00bb Configuration \u00bb People \u00bb Legal\u201d and click \u201cAdd T C\u201d, then fill-out the boxes with your custom text to be displayed to every user who requests an account on the system. You may ask: why is there not a default \u201cTerms of Service\u201d? Because... the text really depends on the way you are using PECE, so our legal documents won\u2019t not suit your case, you need to craft your own text according to the usage you are making of PECE. We are not (cannot and should not be) responsible for any use authorized researchers or any other person make of the platform. Please, refer to our section on \u201cLegal Documents\u201d for more information about the software licenses we use for the PECE project (and for the Free Software technology we use from the Drupal project). How do I configure AES? To config AES, go to: \u201cAdministration \u00bb Configuration \u00bb System \u00bb AES settings\u201d. Make sure to point to a secure directory outside the webroot where PECE is installed to store your key and make it read-only (to the owner of the httpd service), instead of having it stored in the database (which tends to be a much less secure option). How do I configure Amber to archive links on the platform? PECE comes pre-shipped with Amber, so if you have an account on Perma.cc you can set PECE up to use it an store your snapshots there. This is the way to go when it comes to long-term preservation of content for scholarly purposes. Go to \u201cAdministration \u00bb Configuration \u00bb Content authoring \u00bb Amber\u201d and select \u201cperma.cc\u201d as alternate backend and provide your API key in the text field below. Done! You are storing \u201cPECE Website\u201d link artifacts, hopefully, for many future anthropological lives and times now. How do I set up back-ups? As explained in our data management guidelines, PECE is configured to automatically generate backups. You should, however, revise the settings and set-up a SFTP connection to transfer your backup to another server and ensure that you have extra security when storing your encrypted backups. First, revise the settings we provided, changing whatever you think is needed (say, the most convenient time, when the site is not being used, to generate the backup). Go to \u201cConfiguration \u00bb System \u00bb Backup and Migrate\u201d to perform this first step. Then, click on \u201cDestinations\u201d and \u201cAdd Destination\u201d to set-up the SFTP connection with the credentials of your backup server. Please note that you have to use the port 22 (not 21) and password authentication, since ssh-key authentication is unfortunately not supported yet. How do I configure SMTP so that emails can be sent from the platform? PECE uses Drupal notification for key events on the system. It has to be configured using a regular email address, provided you have all the mail server information. You just need your SMTP server info and credentials to get this done. Go to \u201cAdministration \u00bb Configuration \u00bb System \u00bb SMTP Authentication Support\u201d and provide your SMTP server information, including username and password. How do I configure Zotero? Navigate to /admin/modules, and turn on modules the Feed Admin UI and Feeds Importer. Flush all caches. Navigate to admin/structure/feeds/zotero_feed. To the right under, Zotero Process, select Settings to configure the Zotero Importer module. Most settings here can remain the same.

While logged-in as an administrator, navigate to Administration Configuration Media File Settings. Under the Maximum Upload Size field, enter a new value (we use 2GB). Click Save Configuration. You may also need to increase the upload limit on the server. How do I update the platform when a new instance of distro is released? Always back-up your files and database before updating the platform. Put the site in maintenance mode. Under sites/default/, there is a file called settings.php. Search for \\$update_free_access = FALSE; and change FALSE to TRUE. Then, go to YourSite/update.php and follow the steps. In theory major updates are not handled differently, but sometimes issues have occurred. Be sure to turn off maintenance mode when you are done. Other Post-Installation Troubleshooting \u201cTime Out\u201d during installation: this issue is related to the usage of Drupal distributions in \u201cshared hosting\u201d environments which are very limited in terms of the resources allocated per client / user account. If the installation process is interrupted before it is finished, you will have to check your PHP configuration and increase the memory allocation and timeout configuration for the php scripts with the following directives: memory_limit and max_execution_time which can be found in your php.ini file. After doing so, you should not experience more \u201ctimeouts\u201d during installation. Links do not work: your webserver is not properly configured to support what is called \u201cClean URLs\u201d on Drupal. Make sure you have your httpd \u201crewrite\u201d rules properly set-up. This configuration can be done in the vhost file of your nginx configuration, following the Perusio guide or using the default.htaccess file that is provided by default by Drupal if you are running Apache. Permission denied when uploading content: your filesystem permissions must be set accordingly for the public and private directories, since PECE uses both extensively. Follow this official Drupal tutorial to configure the permissions properly for both directories where you installed PECE. Permission denied when uploading content after configuring filesystem permissions: make sure your /tmp is also writable and, if you are on a shared host and cannot have access to it, configure Drupal to point to a temporary directory in your system/files path. There is a discussion about this issue on Drupal.org that is helpful . Cannot create users, server internal error: in our experience, php5-mcrypt is probably not installed in your system.

Substantive logics document the rationale for running a particular instance of PECE or for conducting a particular research project. They can be associated with Projects or Groups. How is it different than a design logic? \u201c...design logics are critical directives, informed by a design community\u2019s habits and assumptions about language, and by its philosophical commitments, which direct the architecture and arrangement of content in the systems they produce. As design logics shape the way digital systems are designed, the resulting material infrastructure comes to embody the designer\u2019s worldviews.\u201d (Poirier 2017) The designers of PECE outlined a series of design directives when architecting the platform. These design directives orient how content is organized in the system and how users can interact with the system\u2019s affordances. Since these logics shape how research in the system is conducted and organized, these design logics are an important piece of metadata for the platform as a whole and for any research that is conducted on the platform. They provide insight into the traditions of research and thinking that have informed the design of workflows and data management on PECE. PECE\u2019s design logics travel with every instance of the platform and cannot be edited by platform contributors. Where can I find a list of design logics on the site? Navigate to the \u2018About\u2019 link in the main menu. There will be a tab on this page for \u2018Design Logics\u2019, where all of the platform\u2019s design logics will be listed.

You can also access substantive logics that have been associated with specific projects or groups from their respective pages. How do I add substantive logics to projects? When creating a project , there will be a field that allows users to reference substantive logics that have already been added to the platform. Begin typing the title of the substantive logic into this field and the system should begin searching for the link to the logic. Upon saving the project, the substantive logic should be linked from the project page. How do I add substantive logics to groups? When creating a group, there will be a field that allows users to reference substantive logics that have already been added to the platform. Begin typing the title of the substantive logic into this field and the system should begin searching for the link to the logic. Upon saving the group, the substantive logic should be linked from the group page. Projects and Fieldsites What is a project? A project designates a research project that the platform is being used to scaffold. You can use this content type to describe when a project starts and ends, its institutional affiliation, and its funding source. How do I add a project? Navigate to your \u2018Dashboard\u2019. This link will be listed in the main menu. Under the \u2018Add Content\u2019 heading, select \u2018Project\u2019. You will be directed to a web form to create the content. Enter the relevant fields.

See How do I add a person to a group or manage group memberships? How do I join a group? Navigate to \u2018Collaborate\u2019. This tab is listed on the main menu bar. Here, you will find all of the open groups. Navigate by clicking through the arrows on the bottom of the pages, or by searching if you know the name of the group. If there are any groups that you would like to join, click on the link to navigate to the group page. Click \u2018Subscribe to group\u2019 on the right hand of the screen. The group administrator will have to approve your request before you are considered a member of a group, and this may take some time. Once you are listed as a member, you should be able to begin associating content with a group. I\u2019ve requested membership to a group, but I cannot add to it, and it is not listed in my Dashboard. What is going on? Currently when you request membership to a group, the button on the group page changes to read \u201cUnsubscribe from Group\u201d even though you have not yet been approved by the group admin as a group member. This is a known bug , and we hope to have it fixed soon. If you requested membership to a group and cannot add to it, you likely have not yet been approved. You should contact to the group administrator, which will soon be listed on the group page. How do I add a person to a group or manage group memberships? If you created a group or have been appointed as an administrator of a group, you should be able to navigate to the group\u2019s page from your dashboard or from the \u201cCollaborate\u201d link. As long as you are an owner or administrator for the group, you should see an edit menu on the page. Click on the Group tab, and select the link \u2018People.\u2019 Here you can manage roles for group members, or delete group members. What do the different group membership roles mean? Administrators can manage groups as described above. There is no difference between a researcher and a contributor in a group. I\u2019m trying to approve a user\u2019s request to join a group, and I keep getting an error. What\u2019s going on? This is a bug that has happened to a few group managers over the past couple of months. We don\u2019t quite know what is going on. However, if this keeps happening, delete the user\u2019s request to join the group and then add the user manually by navigating to the group page, clicking on the group tab, and then clicking the \u201cAdd People\u201d link. How do I add content I\u2019ve created to a group? Navigate to \u2018Dashboard\u2019. This link is listed in the main menu. Select the content you\u2019d like to add. You will be directed to a web form to create the content. Enter the relevant fields. If the content is being added to a group, be sure to use the \u2018Group Audience\u2019 field to mark this. Save the content. How do I add content others have created to a group? Navigate to the content you\u2019d like to add to a group. Click on the \u201cEdit Group Audience\u201d tab. Select the group to which you would like to add the content. Save the content. How do I add content to multiple groups? Follow the same protocol for adding content, but when selecting \u201cgroup audience\u201d select multiple groups by holding the \u201cctrl\u201d key and clicking as many groups as you would like to associate the content to. Users may associate (or unassociate) content with groups at any time. Note that when adding content to multiple groups, the group content visibility field will be applied to all of the groups that the content is associated with. There is no way to override this. How do I make a group a sub-group of another group? Navigate to \u2018Dashboard\u2019. This link is listed in the main menu. Select the \u2018group\u201d link under \u201cAdd Content.\u201d Follow the steps to create a group. Under the \u201cGroup Audience\u201d field, select the group that you would like to be the parent of this sub-group. Save the group. I\u2019ve made a new group a sub-group of an existing group? Why is the content in the sub-group not appearing in the parent group? Sub-groups are simply pointers to parent groups. Parent groups do not adopt the content of their sub-groups. This feature simply lets users know that there is a hierarchical relationship between the groups. Overview For an overview of how to add and manage groups on PECE, please see the following YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U video_id=aZusE6G1aFY Archival space What type of content can I add? See Data Type Glossary What is the difference between a text artifact and a field note? A text artifact and a fieldnote are technically very similar. However, unlike a text artifact, a fieldnote will not have a title; the date the fieldnote was created will become the title. Also a fieldnote will appear in the field diary on user\u2019s dashboard. If associated with a group, a fieldnote will also appear under the Field Diary tab of the group\u2019s page, ordered by the date created. What is an artifact bundle, and why would I use it? An artifact bundle is an artifact that links to several other existing artifacts. You can create an artifact bundle so that you may annotate a group of artifacts together. How do I add content? Navigate to \u2018Dashboard\u2019. This link is listed in the main menu. Select the content you\u2019d like to add. You will be directed to a web form to create the content. Enter the relevant fields. If the content is being added to a group, be sure to use the \u2018Group Audience\u2019 field to mark this. Save the content. What do I enter into the Contributor field? Do I enter myself as a Contributor? The contributor field allows you to designate who is contributing this artifact to the platform. In many other digital systems, the \u201cContributor\u201d is assumed to be whoever hits the \u201cSave\u201d button. However, we recognize that sometimes, PECE users are contributing materials on the behalf of someone else, and so in this system, the contributor is whoever gets listed in this field. You should list yourself as a contributor. How do I designate that multiple contributors added a piece of content to the platform? If there is more than one researcher contributing content, you can use the Contributor field to reference other users in the platform that contributed the content. What is \u201ccritical commentary\u201d? Artifacts that you upload that may be protected by copyright law can only be posted on the site if they fall under the \u201cFair Use\u201d provisions of copyright law. Within \u201cFair Use\u201d provisions, exceptions to laws that prohibit the replication of copyrighted material are made for materials that are the subject of scholarly \u201ccritical commentary\u201d or to materials that are being copied for educational purposes. In this field, you should provide commentary on the artifact that documents why it is important and why it is relevant to the platform, along with an analysis of the artifact. Keep in mind most analysis will take place in the annotations. See sections on the Bibliography field, Source field, and Licensing for more information about attribution of artifacts. Filling in this field is mandatory. When I upload a file the system asks me which folder I should save the file to in the server. Should I save the content to the private or public folder? Always, save the content to the private folder, which should be selected as a default. Hopefully we can make this screen go away soon. How do I select a file that has already been added to the system? When creating a piece of content, under the Image Upload field, click the \u2018Browse\u2019 button to select a file from the existing PECE library. Select the \u2018Library\u2019 tab. Choose a file and hit the \u2018Submit\u2019 button. What does \u201cSource\u201d mean? Use this field to describe where/how you found the artifact. We have purposefully designated this field as a long text, allowing you to elaborate/thickly describe from where the artifact came. What does \u201cLanguage\u201d mean? Use this field to select the language the artifact is in. What does \u201cFormat\u201d mean? Use this field to enter the file format/extension of the content (.jpg, .pdf, .ogg, .mp4) How do I add content to a group? See Adding content to groups . How do I set the group content visibility for an artifact? See Group Content Permissions . How do I list the creator (author, photographer, composer) of a piece of content when they are not part of the system? When creating an artifact, the Creator field can be used to designate the author of a piece of content when that creator is not a user of the system. Technically, this field is a tag. This means that if content in the system has already been tagged with the creator, you should be given the option to select this creator\u2019s name when you begin typing in this field. Otherwise, upon saving the artifact, the creator\u2019s name will become a new \u201cCreator tag\u201d in the system. How do I add a fieldsite to an artifact? First the fieldsite needs to have already been added to the platform. See How do I add a fieldsite ? for instructions on how to do this. What does \u201cbibliography\u201d mean? When creating both website artifacts and PDF artifacts, there will be a \u2018bibliography\u2019 field. Using this field you can reference Zotero entries that have been imported into the platform. Begin typing the title of the Zotero entry, and the system should begin searching for the link to that Zotero entry. Upon saving the artifact, the Zotero entry should be linked from the artifact page. How do I select a license? In order to select the appropriate license for an artifact, please refer to the Licensing section. How do I select a permission? See Content Permissions section. How should I tag content? See Tagging Etiquette section. When I edit content, what should I include in the revision log message? If a researcher cites a piece of content on the platform on a particular date, and then the content creator revises the content on a later date, it is important to be able to track which version of the PECE content the researcher was citing. PECE enables users to track changes made to content over time. In the revision log message section, users should summarize changes they make the content, so that it is easier to track the changes. See Where can I access older versions of content? for where to track these changes. Where can I access older versions of content? When logged in, navigate to the content. Click on the \u2018Revisions\u2019 tab. If there is no \u2018Revisions\u2019 tab, it means that no changes have been made to the content. Under the \u2018Revisions\u2019 tab, you can click on a date - time under the Revisions column to access older versions of the content. You can also compare a newer version of content to an older version by selecting two versions under the Compare column and clicking the \u2018Compare\u2019 button. I\u2019ve identified my content as having multiple contributors, but those contributors don\u2019t have access to edit the content. What\u2019s going on? Identifying contributors only credits those site users involved in contributing the content. It does not grant those users access to edit the content. Only the content creator can edit the content. Where can I find my fieldnotes? Navigate to your \u2018Dashboard\u2019. This link will be in the main menu. On your dashboard, there will be a tab labeled \u2018Field Diary\u2019. Click on this tab to access your fieldnotes. They will be ordered chronologically. Why do my published images appear blurry? Currently, when images are uploaded to PECE, the files are compressed, and the image quality downgrades. If this is a problem for your content, you should reach out to your site administrator and ask to have the quality upgraded. Can I download files from the platform? You cannot download files that are listed as All Rights Reserved. Please see the Licensing section for more information about this. Audio files and video files that have been added as a part of Open artifacts can be downloaded from the platform. Navigate to the artifact page where the file is displayed. In the bottom right hand corner of the rendered file, there will be an upside down arrow. Click this button to download the file. PDF files that have been added as part of Open artifacts can also be downloaded from the platform. Navigate to the artifact page where the file is displayed. When you hover over the PDF viewer, a bar will display at the top. In the upper right hand corner of this bar, there will be an upside down arrow. Click this button to download the file. Right now, there is not a simple way to download image files. You can right click on the image and Save the file to your computer however. Can I add a Youtube or Vimeo video to the platform? Currently, you cannot embed a YouTube for Vimeo video in the platform. It is on our PECE Wishlist to be able to do this in the future. For now you can add a link to the video as a Website artifact. Can I add a map to the platform? Currently the only way to share a map on the platform is by capturing an image of it and uploading it to the site as an image artifact, or alternatively by uploading a link to the map as a Website artifact. Analysis space What is the difference between a structured analytic, an analytic, and an annotation? Analytic : An analytic is a question designed to elicit various viewpoints about the artifact. Structured Analytic: A structured analytic is named set of organized questions. Annotation : Annotating an artifact involves responding to a set of shared and evolving questions that are designed to elicit various viewpoints about the artifact. In the vocabulary of literature (the humanities field most akin to our tradition of anthropology), you can think of annotating an artifact as \u201creading\u201d an artifact. Each reading, performed by different individuals, produces different interpretive insights that broaden and deepen the collaborative analysis of an artifact. How do I create a structured analytic? Technically, a structured analytic is a tag that gets applied to an analytic. So let\u2019s say that you have the question: \u201cWhat is the main argument of the article?\u201d and you want to add it to a structured analytic called \u201cAnalyzing a research paper.\u201d In PECE, \u201cAnalyzing a research paper\u201d would be a tag that the user associates with the question. By structuring the structured analytic as a tag (rather than a folder or some other encompassing structure), users can associate their questions with more than one structured analytic without having to duplicate the question in multiple structured analytic folders. Because of this, in order to create a structured analytic, the user should simply create an analytic and add a new tag (by clicking on the green \u2018+\u2019 next to the list of question sets). The user will be directed to a new form where they can name the structured analytic and add a description. Once the analytic is saved the structured analytic will be added to the list of structured analytics with which analytics can be associated. How do I create an analytic? Navigate to \u2018Dashboard\u2019. This link is listed in the main menu. Under the \u2018Add Content\u2019 heading, select \u2018Analytic\u2019. You will be directed to a web form to create the content. Enter the relevant fields. Select the structured analytic that the analytic will be added to. If you would like to add the analytic to a new structured analytic, follow the instructions for creating a new structured analytic . Save the content. How do I annotate an artifact? Navigate to the artifact you would like to annotate. Click the \u2018Annotate\u2019 button below the artifact. Select a \u2018Structured Analytic\u2019 (set of questions) that you will use to annotate the artifact, and click \u2018Continue\u2019. Select a question to respond to, and click \u2018Continue\u2019. To add a question, Select Create new , enter the question title in the field that appears, and click \u2018Continue\u2019. Enter the relevant fields, and click \u2018Save and Continue\u2019. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until finished annotating and then click \u2018Finish\u2019. Do I have to answer all of the questions for a certain structured analytic when annotating an artifact? No, you can skip a question. How do I select a permission? See Content Permissions section. When creating an annotation, if I hit Save and Continue, and then decide I do not want to answer another question, there is no button for \u2018Finish\u2019 from the window that lists structured analytics or the window that lists analytics. Will I lose all of my work if I close out of the window? No, as soon as you hit Save and Continue, the response to your question is saved. You can now close out of the window or \u2018Cancel\u2019 at any point without losing your previously saved work. How do I edit an annotation? PECE users should be able to edit their own annotations from any interface where their annotations are displayed by clicking on the \u2018Edit Annotation\u2019 button. See How do I access my annotations? . How do I edit an analytic? The titles of analytics should not be edited for any reason. Since all questions on the platform are shared, and users likely have used the question to annotate an artifact, changing the text of the question could comprise the context of existing annotations on the platform. To add the analytic to another structured analytic, navigate to the page for analytic, and click the \u2018Edit\u2019 tab. Check the box for the structured analytic to which you would like to add the analytic. How do I see a list of all existing structured analytics? In the newest update to PECE, navigate to the \u2018Analyze\u2019 link. This link will be listed in the main menu. A list of all existing structured analytics will appear here. How do I see a list of all analytics in a given structured analytic? In the newest update to PECE, navigate to the \u2018Analyze\u2019 link. This link will be listed in the main menu. A list of all existing structured analytics will appear here. Click on the structured analytic to be directed to a list of analytics that have been designated a part of that structured analytic. How do I access my annotations? There are a few options for accessing annotations. Navigate to your \u2018Dashboard\u2019 and click on the tab for \u2018Annotated Artifacts\u2019. Navigate to an artifact that you\u2019ve annotated. Under the rendered file and the \u2018Annotate\u2019 button, you will see a list of users that have annotated the artifact. Click on your username to see your annotations of the artifact. Navigate to the \u2018Analyze\u2019 link in the main menu. Click on a structured analytic you\u2019ve used to annotate an artifact and a question that you\u2019ve used to annotate an artifact. You can then filter this page to your username to see the annotations that you\u2019ve created from this question. How do I see how others annotated an artifact? Navigate to the artifact. Under the rendered file and the \u2018Annotate\u2019 button, you will see a list of users that have annotated the artifact. Click on a username to view their annotations. From the page that lists the user\u2019s annotation of an artifact, you can also click on a question to see how multiple users responded to that question for the artifact. How do I see all of the responses to a particular analytic? In the newest update to PECE, navigate to the \u2018Analyze\u2019 link. This link will be listed in the main menu. A list of all existing structured analytics will appear here. Click on the structured analytic to be directed to a list of analytics that have been designated a part of that structured analytic. Click on the analytic to view all responses to the analytic. From here you can filter the responses to a particular user\u2019s responses or to responses to a particular artifact. How do I see all of the responses to a particular analytic for a given artifact? See How do I see all of the responses to a particular analytic? How do I see all of the responses to a particular analytic created by a given user? See How do I see all of the responses to a particular analytic? I annotated a Private or Restricted artifact, and my annotation is appearing in both Search and on Tag pages. Shouldn\u2019t my annotation be Private or Restricted if it is responding to a Private or Restricted artifact? Yes, it should. Unfortunately, right now, all annotations default to Open. This is a known bug , and we are hoping to have it fixed soon. Annotation Etiquette There are several important things to remember when creating analytics for the platform. All analytics are shared by everyone across the platform. As soon as you create an analytic, it is available to everyone in the platform to use for annotating any artifact. PECE has been designed to take advantage of this. As diverse users respond to the same set of questions, it becomes possible to juxtapose answers to questions. Therefore, You should avoid creating questions that respond to only one artifact or are relevant to only a very specific fieldsite within a broad structured analytic . For instance, you should avoid adding a question like, \u201cHow has the Obama administration\u2019s Open Government Directive influenced the New York City open data policy?\u201d under a structured analytic called \u201cProfiling a Policy.\u201d Instead, a question like, \u201cHow have existing policies and directives influenced the structure and content of this policy?\u201d would be accessible to many users on the platform to annotate many artifacts about diverse policies. More specific questions should all be categorized into Structured Analytic . A question like \u201cHow has the Obama administration\u2019s Open Government Directive influenced the New York City open data policy?\u201d would be appropriate in a structured analytic called \u201cProfiling the New York City open data policy,\u201d which could be useful if a set of researchers were all going to be annotating artifacts related to the New York City open data policy. It can be valuable to use the structured analytic headings to cordon off more specific questions so that certain groups can respond to the same set of questions. For instance, in The Asthma Files , we have one Structured Analytic called \u201cSpecial Issue for Transport Policy.\u201d A group of researchers created this analytic so that they can share a set of questions for annotating each other\u2019s abstracts for a special issue to which they were all contributing articles. While these questions were not relevant to any other users on the platform, categorizing the questions under the \u201cSpecial Issue for Transport Policy\u201d structured analytic, separated these questions out from other more general questions. Be sure to navigate the existing structured analytics by clicking on \u2018Analyze\u2019 in the main menu before creating a new analytic or structured analytic. If you see questions or sets of questions similar to the ones you were planning to create, gauge whether there is analytic value to create a separate analytic. If you do create a separate analytic, it will not be possible to juxtapose the responses to this question to the responses the similar questions you identified. This is a tradeoff that you will need to consider. If a question is relevant to more than one structured analytic, categorize it under both structured analytics following these instructions. Do not duplicate the analytic to categorize it under a separate structured analytic. Overview For an overview of how to annotate artifacts, please see the following YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U video_id=bB2X8lZWyVY Publication space What is the difference between a memo, a photo essay, and a PECE essay? A memo is a first draft of a piece of writing that may be published on the site. Upon publishing a memo, that memo is opened for comments from the platform\u2019s community. A photo essay is a collection of image artifacts, ordered into a slideshow, with text added for context. For an example of a photo essay, see here A PECE essay is a collection of artifacts, memos, and essays, organized into a collage, with text added for context. For an example of a PECE essay, see here How do I create a memo? Navigate to your \u2018Dashboard\u2019. This link will be listed in the main menu. Under the \u2018Add Content\u2019 heading, select \u2018Memo\u2019. You will be directed to a web form to create the content. Enter the relevant fields (explained in other parts of this document). Save the content. How do I create a photo essay? Navigate to your \u2018Dashboard\u2019. This link will be listed in the main menu. Under the \u2018Add Content\u2019 heading, select \u2018Photo Essay\u2019. You will be directed to a web form to create the content. In the \u2018image artifact\u2019 field, begin typing the name of the artifact you would like to link into the photo essay. In the \u2018text\u2019 field, enter the essay text that you wish to display with the image artifact. Click the \u2018Create Item\u2019 button. To add another photo essay slide, click the \u2018Add New Item\u2019 button. Once done, fill out the remaining fields (explained in other parts of this document), and save the content. For an overview of how to create photo essays, see this YouTube video . How do I reorder photos in a photo essay? Once you\u2019ve created photo essay items, you can reorder photos by clicking and holding on the \u2018+\u2019 symbol next to the item and dragging the item to a new order. How do I create a PECE essay? Navigate to your \u2018Dashboard\u2019. This link will be listed in the main menu. Under the \u2018Add Content\u2019 heading, select \u2018PECE Essay\u2019. You will be directed to a web form to create the content. Enter the relevant fields. Save the content. This first step will only capture the metadata for the essay. To design the essay, navigate to the essay page you just created and click \u2018View Essay\u2019. At the bottom of the screen there will be a black bar that says \u2018Customize this page\u2019. Click this button to begin to the customize the page. To add content to the page, click the \u2018+\u2019 button in the blue \u2018Content\u2019 box. From this screen, you can add image files (not artifacts; just the images), maps, free text, content (artifact, annotations, memos, and essays) stored elsewhere on the platform, and headers for specific portions of the essay. To add content stored elsewhere on the platform, click the \u2018Add Content\u2019 button, begin typing the title of the content, and select the appropriate content from the drop-down list. Select a view mode from the drop-down menu below. A preview of how the content will be rendered will appear on the right of the screen. Click Save. To reorder content on the page, after you\u2019ve clicked the \u2018Customize this page\u2019 button, you can click and hold on content boxes and drag them to new locations. Once you\u2019re done creating your essay, click the \u2018Save\u2019 button in the black box at the bottom of the page. For an overview of how to create PECE essays, see this YouTube video. How do I comment on publications? Navigate to the memo, photo essay, or PECE Essay that you would like to comment on. As long as you are logged in, you will see a heading to \u2018Add New Comment\u2019 on the bottom of the page. Enter a subject, a comment, and click \u2018Save\u2019. Licensing Please review this link for an explanation of how to apply Creative Commons licenses to content on the platform. Zotero How do I add a zotero feed to the platform? Please note; you should only need to create a Zotero feed once per Zotero library. Once the feed has been created in PECE, any entries added to the Zotero library afterwards will automatically be imported into PECE within a half hour. Navigate to \u201cDashboard.\u201d Under \u201cAdd Content,\u201d select \u201cZotero Feed.\u201d Title your feed. If importing a group library, To find your group id, navigate to your groups\u2019 settings page and the numeric part of the URL is your group id. If importing a user library, navigate to settings/keys in Zotero. Your ID will follow the sentence \u201cYour userID for use in API calls is\u201d If you\u2019d only like to import a single collection, select \u201cFetch Collections.\u201d If you enter a collection id, only items from that collection will be fetched from Zotero. Collections are the \u201cfolders\u201d in your Zotero library. To find the id of a collection, go to your library, click on a collection to see its content, and look at the page URL. The collection id is the last item in the path, after \u201ccollectionKey/\u201d. To get an API key, navigate to settings/keys in Zotero. Select \u201cCreate new private key.\u201d Enter a key description (e.g. The Asthma Files). Under \u201cPersonal Library,\u201d select \u201cAllow library access,\u201d \u201cAllow notes access,\u201d \u201cAllow write access.\u201d If importing a user library, under \u201cDefault Group Permissions,\u201d select the level of access PECE should have to group entries (we recommend selecting \u201cNone\u201d here). If importing a group library, select \u201cNone\u201d here (you will select the individual group permissions in the next step.) If importing a Group, check \u201cPer Group Permissions\u201d and then select \u201cRead/Write\u201d access for the group that you will be importing. Save Key. Copy and paste the key generated in Zotero into the field \u201cZotero API key\u201d in PECE. Publish. Large libraries will likely take several minutes to import. Do not worry if the progress bar doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s moving. Now any entries added to this Zotero library will automatically be added to the platform within a half hour. All website entries within the Zotero library will automatically be added to PECE as website artifacts with the citation already linked to the artifact. For an overview of adding a Zotero feed in the platform, see this YouTube video . What happens to my Zotero collections when I import a feed into PECE? When you import a Zotero feed into PECE, each Zotero entry that was previously in a collection (or enclosing folder) in Zotero will be tagged with that folder in PECE. These tags will be separate from free tags. So if a Zotero entry is imported into PECE that had been in a folder called New York City, it will have a collection tag in the platform called \u2018New York City\u2019; however, clicking on this tag in the platform will not link to a page that will list artifacts tagged with New York City because the collection tags are separate from the free tags. How do I access a platform bibliography? Navigate to the \u201cDiscover\u201d page. This link is in the main menu. In the right hand sidebar, there should be a link entitled \u201cPECE Bibliography.\u201d Click on this link to access the platform\u2019 bibliography. How do I cite pdf and website artifacts using zotero entries? See What does \u2018bibliography\u2019 mean? Tagging Etiquette Tagging is key to PECE because it facilitates showcasing the multiplicity of perspectives surrounding any piece of content. Any piece of content on the platform can be tagged by any user on the platform with any term. When users navigate to the page for a tag, they will see, in a random order, everything on the site that has been tagged with that term. This further showcases the multiplicity of perspectives surrounding the meaning of a term and facilitates \u201cchance encounters\u201d amongst data that may not have otherwise been juxtaposed. Because of this, we have ignored many of the \u201cdo\u2019s/don\u2019t\u2019s\u201d that come out of the literature on collaborative tagging systems. In order to make this work, however, (and not spiral into total chaos), we recommend that you adhere to the following rules of etiquette when tagging. If your tag or something similar shows up in the Autocomplete function as you begin typing it, consider whether the existing tag will work to describe your content. A goal of PECE is to show connections between disparate content through tags, and tagging several pieces of content with the same tag facilitates this. However, we also recognize that it may be analytically significant to tag a piece of content with \u2018knowledges\u2019 vs. \u2018knowledge\u2019 or \u2018Truth\u2019 vs. \u2018truth\u2019. Tag each term separately rather than adding conjunction punctuation to show hierarchy. There is no benefit on this platform to linking words together in a hierarchy. For instance, there is no benefit on this platform to tagging an artifact with \u2018Colors \u2013 Blue\u2019 rather than tagging the artifact with both \u2018Colors\u2019 and \u2018Blue\u2019. In fact tagging in the former is likely to inhibit others from stumbling across your content. Tag any content with any terms that you deem appropriate (even if those terms conflict with the current tags for the content). Tagging is a key functionality behind facilitating \u201cchance encounters\u201d amongst disparate data on this platform. Importantly, tagging fills the tag pages with content.

Search Is there a way to search across instances of the platform? We are hoping that this will be possible very soon.

Discover A bunch of website and PDF artifacts just appeared in the platform and don\u2019t have a contributor listed. Where did these artifacts come from? When a Zotero feed is added to the platform , the platform automatically imports new entries from the Zotero library every 30 minutes. Whenever new journal article or website Zotero entries are imported to the platform, a PDF or website artifact is automatically created with the Zotero entry listed in the \u2018bibliography\u2019 field .

These design directives orient how content is organized in the system and how users can interact with the system\u2019s affordances. Since these logics shape how research in the system is conducted and organized, these design logics are an important piece of metadata for the platform as a whole and for any research that is conducted on the platform.

All analytics are shared by everyone across the platform. As soon as you create an analytic, it is available to everyone in the platform to use for annotating any artifact. PECE has been designed to take advantage of this. As diverse users respond to the same set of questions, it becomes possible to juxtapose answers to questions. Therefore, You should avoid creating questions that respond to only one artifact or are relevant to only a very specific fieldsite within a broad structured analytic . For instance, you should avoid adding a question like, \u201cHow has the Obama administration\u2019s Open Government Directive influenced the New York City open data policy?\u201d under a structured analytic called \u201cProfiling a Policy.\u201d Instead, a question like, \u201cHow have existing policies and directives influenced the structure and content of this policy?\u201d would be accessible to many users on the platform to annotate many artifacts about diverse policies. More specific questions should all be categorized into Structured Analytic . A question like \u201cHow has the Obama administration\u2019s Open Government Directive influenced the New York City open data policy?\u201d would be appropriate in a structured analytic called \u201cProfiling the New York City open data policy,\u201d which could be useful if a set of researchers were all going to be annotating artifacts related to the New York City open data policy. It can be valuable to use the structured analytic headings to cordon off more specific questions so that certain groups can respond to the same set of questions. For instance, in The Asthma Files , we have one Structured Analytic called \u201cSpecial Issue for Transport Policy.\u201d A group of researchers created this analytic so that they can share a set of questions for annotating each other\u2019s abstracts for a special issue to which they were all contributing articles. While these questions were not relevant to any other users on the platform, categorizing the questions under the \u201cSpecial Issue for Transport Policy\u201d structured analytic, separated these questions out from other more general questions. Be sure to navigate the existing structured analytics by clicking on \u2018Analyze\u2019 in the main menu before creating a new analytic or structured analytic. If you see questions or sets of questions similar to the ones you were planning to create, gauge whether there is analytic value to create a separate analytic. If you do create a separate analytic, it will not be possible to juxtapose the responses to this question to the responses the similar questions you identified. This is a tradeoff that you will need to consider. If a question is relevant to more than one structured analytic, categorize it under both structured analytics following these instructions. Do not duplicate the analytic to categorize it under a separate structured analytic.","title":"Annotation Etiquette"},{"location":"usersguide/#overview_1","text":"For an overview of how to annotate artifacts, please see the following YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U video_id=bB2X8lZWyVY","title":"Overview"},{"location":"usersguide/#publication-space","text":"","title":"Publication space"},{"location":"usersguide/#what-is-the-difference-between-a-memo-a-photo-essay-and-a-pece-essay","text":"A memo is a first draft of a piece of writing that may be published on the site.

Any piece of content on the platform can be tagged by any user on the platform with any term. When users navigate to the page for a tag, they will see, in a random order, everything on the site that has been tagged with that term. This further showcases the multiplicity of perspectives surrounding the meaning of a term and facilitates \u201cchance encounters\u201d amongst data that may not have otherwise been juxtaposed. Because of this, we have ignored many of the \u201cdo\u2019s/don\u2019t\u2019s\u201d that come out of the literature on collaborative tagging systems. In order to make this work, however, (and not spiral into total chaos), we recommend that you adhere to the following rules of etiquette when tagging. If your tag or something similar shows up in the Autocomplete function as you begin typing it, consider whether the existing tag will work to describe your content. A goal of PECE is to show connections between disparate content through tags, and tagging several pieces of content with the same tag facilitates this. However, we also recognize that it may be analytically significant to tag a piece of content with \u2018knowledges\u2019 vs. \u2018knowledge\u2019 or \u2018Truth\u2019 vs. \u2018truth\u2019. Tag each term separately rather than adding conjunction punctuation to show hierarchy. There is no benefit on this platform to linking words together in a hierarchy. For instance, there is no benefit on this platform to tagging an artifact with \u2018Colors \u2013 Blue\u2019 rather than tagging the artifact with both \u2018Colors\u2019 and \u2018Blue\u2019. In fact tagging in the former is likely to inhibit others from stumbling across your content. Tag any content with any terms that you deem appropriate (even if those terms conflict with the current tags for the content). Tagging is a key functionality behind facilitating \u201cchance encounters\u201d amongst disparate data on this platform. Importantly, tagging fills the tag pages with content. Tagging also allows the platform to capture the multiplicity of terms used to characterize a piece of content, which is a key design logic.","title":"Tagging Etiquette"},{"location":"usersguide/#search","text":"","title":"Search"},{"location":"usersguide/#is-there-a-way-to-search-across-instances-of-the-platform","text":"We are hoping that this will be possible very soon.
